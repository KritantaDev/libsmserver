# libsmserver

This is the companion tweak to my app, [SMServer](https://github.com/iandwelker/smserver). I would recommend just using the latest provided package under `packages`, since this has some dependencies requirements that most people won't be able to satisfy easily. I'll add a guide later on how to build this from source, but for now just use the packages. I'll try to keep it updated :)
